# TENG-Based Self-Powered Tactile Sensor for Wearable Devices
## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the development of a Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) based self-powered tactile sensor integrated with a Flappy Bird game. The project explores the potential of TENG technology in wearable electronics, demonstrating how biomechanical energy can be harvested and utilized to power and control electronic devices. The Flappy Bird game is developed using the Flutter framework.

## Features
* Tactile Sensor: A TENG-based sensor designed to generate electrical signals from mechanical interactions such as touch and pressure.
* Biomechanical Energy Harvesting: The TENG harvests biomechanical energy and converts it into electrical signals.
* Signal Transmission: Electrical signals generated by the TENG are transmitted via Bluetooth to a computer.
* Interactive Game Control: The Flappy Bird game character is controlled using the TENG-based tactile sensor, showcasing the potential of TENG technology in human-computer interaction.
* Cross-Platform Game Development: The Flappy Bird game is developed using the Flutter framework, allowing it to run on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, and the web.

## Methodology
### Theoretical Basis
The TENG generates electricity when human skin contacts and separates from the PE film, causing charge redistribution and electron flow.

# Limitations and Future Work
* Simulation Variability: Some parameters in the finite element simulations are variable, affecting accuracy.
* Fabrication Precision: Current manufacturing methods for the sensor are not highly precise, impacting reliability.
* Signal Interference: Voltage signals from the TENG can be affected by noise during microcontroller processing.
* Mode Differentiation: Distinguishing between different triboelectric modes (contact-separation, lateral sliding) is challenging. Future work could explore machine learning to enhance accuracy.
